Module 1: Configure Dynamics 365 Marketing
========================

**Important notice for instructors:** Please do not make any changes, including adding licenses or changing tenant password. Tenants are fully provisioned with all necessary licenses, environments, and applications to complete the required tenants. Instructors and students should not add any additional functionality outside of the published lab steps. Adding additional functionality will cause the tenant to break and become inactive, and changing tenant password will inhibit the recycling of the tenant for the next class. Thank you for your cooperation.

## Practice Lab 1.1 - Validate lab environment 

Scenario
--------

In this Module 0 lab, you will validate that your classroom tenant is working as expected. You will access your individual credentials, record your “alias”, and open the Dynamics 365 model-driven application that we will be using throughout the course. 

**Important Note:** This lab will provide you with an actual Dynamics 365 tenant
and licenses for the Power Platform applications you will be using in this
course. Please be aware that the Power Platform is evolving all the time. The
instructions in this document may be different from what you experience in your
actual tenant. It is also possible to experience a delay of several
minutes before the virtual machine has network connectivity to begin the labs.

Exercise 1 - Access the Dynamics 365 application
---------------------------------------------------

### Task 1 – Log into the admin center 

1.  Access **office.com** and log in with your user credentials.

2. Record your user credential up to the **@** symbol on a scratch piece of paper or in Notepad. This will be your lab alias that you will use to differentiate the data you create within the shared Dynamics 365 organization. 

**Important:** Please be aware that this tenant and the Dynamics 365 organization will be shared with the other students in your classroom, like employees would share a tenant when using the Dynamics 365 instance belonging to their organization. Do not use any PII (personally identifiable information) when creating records. It is also good practice to use your username prefix (ex., **mollyc**) in front of all records, data, apps, flows, etc. you create.

### Task 2 – Access the Dynamics 365 application

1. Open browser and navigate to https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/marketing/overview/

2. Sign in with your credentials and click the **Try for Free** button. Follow the steps to create a new trial

3. The Dynamics 365 Marketing application will open.

4. Spend a few minutes exploring the application but do not make any changes.
