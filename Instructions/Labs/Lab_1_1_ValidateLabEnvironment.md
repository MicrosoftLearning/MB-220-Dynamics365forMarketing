Module 1: Configure Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys
========================

# Practice Lab 1.1 - Validate lab environment 

Scenario
--------

In this lab, you will provision Trial licenses for Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys and Dynamics 365 Customer Voice and validate that the tenant is working as expected. You will access your individual credentials and open the Dynamics 365 model-driven application that we will be using throughout the course. 

**Important Note:** This lab will provide you with an actual Dynamics 365 tenant
and licenses for the Power Platform applications you will be using in this
course. Please be aware that the Power Platform is evolving all the time. The
instructions in this document may be different from what you experience in your
actual tenant. It is also possible to experience a delay of several
minutes before the virtual machine has network connectivity to begin the labs.
