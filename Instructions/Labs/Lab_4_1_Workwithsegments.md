# Module 4: Manage segments and subscription centers

## Practice Lab 4.1: Work with segments

# Lab Overview

## Scenario

The first step in setting up the Cross Sell Campaign will be to create the segments for the journey.

The Marketing Coordinator will start by creating a segment for all current, business contacts. The marketing team is also aware that their competitors will occasionally fill out forms on the Contoso Insurance website, so they want to make sure to exclude competitor contacts from all marketing campaigns. 


## Lab Overview

This lab compromises of three exercises:

1. In exercise one, you will create a dynamic segment for all competitors from Humongous Insurance. 

2. In exercise two, you will create a dynamic segment for all active, business contacts and exclude competitor contacts.

3. In exercise three, you will create your own contact record to be able to participate in the customer journey.


## What youâ€™ll need:

- A computer with a Dynamics 365 Marketing environment
