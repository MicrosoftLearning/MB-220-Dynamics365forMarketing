# Module 5: Manage emails and journeys in outbound marketing

## Practice Lab 5.2 – Create and launch an outbound customer journey

# Lab Overview

## Scenario

Now that all the components for the Cross Sell Campaign have been created, the Marketing Coordinator is ready to create the journey and kick off the campaign.

The journey will consist of three emails. The first email will be sent out immediately. The second email will be sent out one week later. The first email is informational, promoting specialized offerings. The second email has a CTA driving the customer to a marketing page with a marketing from. If the customer fills out the form, they will receive a third email thanking them for their submission and letting them know an agent will contact them shortly.
