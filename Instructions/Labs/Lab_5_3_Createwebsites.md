# Module 5: Manage emails and journeys in outbound marketing

## Practice Lab 5.3: Create marketing websites and redirect URLs

# Lab Overview

## Scenario

Once a customer or prospect submits the form for the Cross Sell Campaign, the marketing team wants to redirect the customer to a webpage on the Contoso Insurance website. Since this page is native to their CMS system, they would like to track analytics from this page within Dynamics. They would also like to set up a redirect URL from the form submission on the Cross Sell Campaign marketing page to the website page so that they can view how the traffic is originating to that page.

The Marketing Coordinator will start by creating a marketing website for the product page on their website. This will allow the marketing team to view insights, including referring URL, from the product page within Dynamics.

Next, the Marketing Coordinator will create a redirect URL that will be used on the form for the Cross Sell Campaign marketing page in Dynamics. This URL will drive traffic to the product page on Contoso Insurance's website and they will be able to view the referring URL within Dynamics. 

Finally, the Marketing Coordinator will add the redirect URL to the marketing form for the Cross Sell Campaign. Anyone who submits the form will be redirected to the product page on Contoso Insurance's website. The marketing team will then be able to see these insights in Dynamics.

# Lab Overview
