# Module 7: Manage events

## Practice Lab 7.2: Create an event

# Lab Overview

## Scenario

Contoso Insurance wants to host a Business Appreciation Event as a thank you to their business customers. They plan to use Dynamics to manage the entire event process including planning, registration, and post-event follow up.

The event will take place next month at the Coho Winery in Seattle.

They plan to send an invitation email, a confirmation email for those that register, and a follow up email with a link to a survey to those that attend the event.

For this event, the Marketing Coordinator will need to:

- Create two segments – one for the invitees and one for the event attendees.

- Use Customer Voice to create a survey to gather feedback about the event.

- Create three marketing emails – an invitation, a confirmation, and a post-event follow up email with a link to a survey.

- Create a customer journey that will automate the delivery of the event content.

## Lab Overview

- In the first exercise, you will create the event record.

- In the second exercise, you will create the segments needed to invite contacts to the event and follow up with attendees after the event.
